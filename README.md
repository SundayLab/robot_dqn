# robot_dqn
I needed an environment to experiment with robotics and deep learning. Actually doing RL on the actual robot itself would be 
computational expensive. Chances are good you know that already :) So we are speaking about continious control and DQN. Truth spoken that simply isnt a good solution until you have a low dimensional action output. So its more ore less a lab solution but interesting anyway.

## Getting Started

if you want to see whats going one you can draw the the robots progress with "drawRobot()" coming from "robot_arena"
When you finished learning the model its really fun to do so if you execute your model.

Startig is easy 
  - "robot_local_learn" saves a .h5 model to your projects folder
  - "robot_local_execute" runs the model you save
  - "robot_server_execute" send commands to a random client e.g robot

### Prerequisites

The faster your pc is the better ;)

### Installing

You do need a small number of libraries.

  - numpy
  - keras
  - pygame
 
Depending on your system i would recommend to do it with npm.


## Acknowledgments

if youre curious its fun to start with what i've made but ML is a wide and deep complex there is so much to learn.
Maybe this stuff is helpful for starting your own little project !
