I needed an environment to experiment with robotics and deep learning. Actually doing RL on the actual robot itself would be 
computational expensive. Chances are good you know that already :) So we are speaking about continious control and DQN. Truth spoken that simply isnt a good solution until you have a low dimensional action output. So its more ore less a lab solution but interesting anyway.
